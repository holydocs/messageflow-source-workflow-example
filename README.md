# Example Source Repository

This is an example source repository that automatically triggers the [MessageFlow Aggregator](https://github.com/holydocs/messageflow-aggregator-workflow-example).

## How It Works

When repository is updated:
1. The aggregator is notified
2. Documentation is regenerated

That's it! Check the aggregator repository for the unified documentation.
